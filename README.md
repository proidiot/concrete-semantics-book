# concrete-semantics-book
Working on problems from Concrete Semantics by Nipkow and Klein.

This certainly isn't going to be pretty as I'm still learning the language, but
hopefully things will look better as I progress father into the book.

## Better resources than this repo if you're stuck
If you would also like the get the CLI stuff working,
[the system manual](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/system.pdf) is likely the
correct place to look.

If you need help with more advanced function construction (for example, I wanted
to take an approach that seemed easier to conceptualize but needed a non-default
termination proof), then Alexander Krauss'
[function tutorial](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/functions.pdf) may be exactly
what you need as well.

Once you are into Isar territory,
[the Isar reference](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/doc/isar-ref.pdf) will probably
be worthing keeping on hand.

Two other examples I've seen of folks going through this book which might prove
more useful than my own efforts are:
- [EduPH/concrete-semantics-Sols](https://github.com/EduPH/concrete-semantics-Sols)
- [kolya-vasiliev/concrete-semantics](https://github.com/kolya-vasiliev/concrete-semantics)

## Bugs/Suggestions/"Why on earth did you make such a dumb proof?!"
Much of what is in this repo is just whatever tired Charlie slapped together
while trying to figure out why the tools didn't behave as expected a few minutes
before going to sleep. However, I do very much welcome feedback as the whole
point of this effort is to learn the material. Rather than trying to contact me
by other more diplomatic means, please do leave public feedback (if you are
comfortable with that) in the form of a GitHub issue.
